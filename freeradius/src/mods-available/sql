#  Configuration for the SQL module
#
#  The database schemas and queries are located in subdirectories:
#
#	sql/<DB>/main/schema.sql	Schema
#	sql/<DB>/main/queries.conf	Authorisation and Accounting queries
#
#  Where "DB" is mysql, mssql, oracle, or postgresql.
#
#

	# The sub-module to use to execute queries. This should match
	# the database youre attempting to connect to.

	#
	server = "172.100.0.101"

	# If you are using Oracle then use this instead
#	radius_db = "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=your_sid)))"

	# If you're using postgresql this can also be used instead of the connection info parameters
#	radius_db = "dbname=radius host=localhost user=radius password=raddpass"

        # Postgreql doesn't take tls{} options in its module config like mysql does - if you want to
        # use SSL connections then use this form of connection info parameter
#	radius_db = "host=localhost port=5432 dbname=radius user=radius password=raddpass sslmode=verify-full sslcert=/etc/ssl/client.crt sslkey=/etc/ssl/client.key sslrootcert=/etc/ssl/ca.crt"

	# If you want both stop and start records logged to the

	#
	#  num_sql_socks
	#  connect_failure_retry_delay
	#  lifetime
	#  max_queries

	#
	#  The connection pool is new for 3.0, and will be used in many
	#  modules, for all kinds of connection-related activity.
	#
	# When the server is not threaded, the connection pool
	# limits are ignored, and only one connection is used.
	#
	# If you want to have multiple SQL modules re-use the same
	# connection pool, use "pool = name" instead of a "pool"
	# section.  e.g.
	#
	#	sql1 {
	#	    ...
	#	    pool {
	#	    	 ...
	#	    }
	#	}

		#  Maximum number of connections
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.

		#  to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
		#  no new connections will be opened.

		#  idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is

		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
		#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.
